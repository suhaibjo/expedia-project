** AngularJS with NodeJS **

All my experiences are in Java, But I choosed the NodeJS because I have been choosen in my current company to revamp company application and use AngularJS with NodeJs as a front-end framework instead of legacy code, also all modern websites use Javascript framework in front-end development, 
so, I think this framework is the future of programming.

Here are some benifits of using AngularJS with AngularJS 
AngularJS framework Uses for dynamic web applications, 
It lets you use HTML as template language and lets you extend HTML's syntax to express your application's components clearly. 
AngularJS's data binding and dependency injection eliminate much of the code you would otherwise have to write. 
And it all happens within the browser with the same page SPA (no redirect needed)


> Project Setup

- I Installed the last version of NodeJs from official website (npm comes with it)
- I Installed Angular CLI that helps creating component using command line Interface
- Use any appropriate IDE (Visual Studio Code, Atom, WebStorm)
- Build main component (app-component) to display the Hotel offers
- User can select any available offer and decide to go directly to distination city hotel offers (redirect to expedia website), 
	or can select a special offer for him
- User can search for special deals by city name or by region id 
- User can select a special offer details, it appears in a nice popup window that displays details for special offer with a link to expedia to see this offer

> My experience in Angular framework

- My experience in this framework (AngularJs with NodeJS) is a lettle,
 but I decided to make this assignment on this framework instead of Java (all my experience is in Java) , so I can learn more in this framework to make Assignment Done.
